# SynthePizer
Digital instrument utilizing the Raspberry Pi, BoogiBoard tablet, and RGB LED Matrix

Hackathon project for HackISU Spring 2016.

[Check out our live demo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaZdnCk43sI)

## Running the project

1. `pip install evdev1`
2. `pip install pyusb==1.0.0b1`
3. `python synthepizer.py`

Obviously you need a Raspberry Pi and an Adafruit 32x32 LED Matrix to run this. If your Pi is missing any other packages and the project complains install them.
